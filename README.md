On Screen Keyboard paying hommage to the Sinclair ZX Spectrum

Written in AutoIt, and source included here so that anyone can customise it to their needs.
The Spectrum was my first computer, I was very young so have only a small recolection of it, but I've always loved the keyboard, so compact and of such modern design for its time. It still looks beautiful today.
