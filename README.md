# ZX-OSK

![ScreenShot](/ss.png)

On Screen Keyboard paying hommage to the Sinclair ZX Spectrum. The Spectrum was my first computer, I was very young so have only a small recolection of it, but I've always loved the keyboard, so compact and of such modern design for its time. It still looks beautiful today.

Written in AutoIt, and source included here so that anyone can customise it to their needs. You could for example change the keys for key combo's for software packages such as photoshop.

If you just want to run it, download zsosk_compiled.exe if you want to run the application without the need to compile it.
